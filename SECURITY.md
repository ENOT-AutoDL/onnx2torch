# Reporting a vulnerability

## Introduction

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
Email [Untether Open Source (<oss@untether.ai>)](mailto:oss@untether.ai) instead. We will work with you, to support a responsible disclosure.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

-   Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't
    have access to?
-   Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are *yes*, then you're
probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer
*no*  to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security
issue, so if you're unsure, just email [us](mailto:oss@untether.ai).
